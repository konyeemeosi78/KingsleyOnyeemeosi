									<p><h3>Status Report</h3></p>
									<p>
									    Team meets for the first time and there was discussion around how to schedule further meetings,<br />
									    time availability and task allocation of task.
                                                                            Team contract was designed reviewed by all team members and signed.<br />
									    Further discussion was on status report and the approach to adopt in an attempt, to accomplishing the task.<br />
									    It was agreed to progress the task on individual level. Splitting the task at this point we thought might<br />
									    consume a lot of time since each section depends on the output of the other to progress.<br />
									    However, decision will be made on subsequent meetings on the best approach to adopt in an to accomplishing the task.
                                                                            Team meets again and there was a talk through on what has been done so far on individual bases as we try to<br />
									    surface our difficulties and challenges along the line. It doesn’t appear like we are going to make much progress<br />
									    going forward based on this approach as our findings did not align.<br />
									    Implementing Gantt chat concept at this point was the way to go as it help us with planning and task allocation.<br />
									    It was also agreed that findings should be posted on the team simultaneously to facilitate<br />
									    communication and visibility on what is been done.<br />
									    The next meeting which was scheduled in the same week was held to consolidate what has been done so far.<br />
									    First status report draft was produced which is very much subject to changes at this stage.<br />
									    Further findings was made on the risks that are specific to a particular solution.<br />
									    Findings, reviews, opinions and changes were made and posted on the chat accordingly.<br />
									    The final meeting was held we talked through our final report as team and have unanimous agreement on report created.
                                                                         </p> 
									 
									<p><h3>Risk Assessment Report</h3></p>
									<p>
									    Progressing from the status report created, the team met again, and it was agreed to<br />
									    collaborate in our work as we aimed to produce a risk assessment report.<br />
									    It was import to justifiable decide which framework will be more suitable for analysis.<br />
									    Again, it was challenging concluding on the framework to use for analysis as none directly satisfy all the requirement.<br />
									    However, after comprehensive literature review, a decision was made to go for<br />
									    hybrid framework (Open FAIR & ISO 27005) and a risk assessment matrix.<br />
									    This helped us in performing further analysis.<br />
									    Analysis was based on  qualitative approach since there was no metrics provided to aid quantitative approach.<br />
									    Based on this analysis we were able to surface appropriate mitigation for all the risk identified in each solution.<br />
									    Based on this outcome we implemented a risk matrix and mapped risk accordingly<br />
									    and risk scores that was generated for each risk identified.<br />
									    Based on this information we created a table which surfaced the risk, scores,<br />
									    approach and mitigation that is relative to a particular solution.<br />
									    With each solution having information relative to them it was only<br />
									    a question of carrying out cost benefit analysis to determine the best solution.<br />
									    However, financial metrics is needed for cost benefit analysis which wasn’t provided hence we based our<br />
									    calculation metrics obtainable for similar organisation in the industry.<br />
									    Based on the outcome of our cost benefit analysis and risk analysis we were able to conclude and recommend<br />
									    the open source solution as the best solution since the risk appetite for ACME manufacturers aligns with it. 
                                                                            Also, in the process of creating Disaster recovery solution we considered factors like<br />
									    recovery point objective (RPO) and recovery time objective (RTO) for ACME manufacturers and their low appetite for risk<br />
									    and try to come up with the most efficient and cost saving solution for Disaster recovery.<br />
									    As part of our research, we compared the cost and benefits,<br />
									    pro and cons of traditional DR which is hosted on the site and a cloud based solution.<br />
									    It  was recommended that ACME adopts the cloud base solution which is not only cost effective but also more maintainable.
