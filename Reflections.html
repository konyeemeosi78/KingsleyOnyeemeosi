									<p><h3>Unit 1</h3></p>
									<p>
									  In this unit learning was centred around a brief history of information security management and some important principle that governs the concept of information security management.<br />
									  There were discussion around cyber security roles and part ways to a fulfilling career in information security management industry though specific roles wasn’t clear at this stage,<br />
									  but the exposure on this was very helpful as it puts on the table some visibility on areas to explore when it comes to career role.<br />
									  This unit was particularly important as it forms some basics for the whole module.<br />
									  Also, there was great awareness on how the whole module was structured going forward.<br />
									  However, meeting with the group wasn’t great at this stage as we struggled with time differences across Zone.<br />
									  Overall, it was great been able to develop a contract and have our team goal mapped out irrespective of this challenge.  
									</p>
							
						
									<p><h3>Unit 2</h3></p>
									<p>
									  Following from unit 1, unit 2 offers me the opportunity to learn and explore the real challenges surrounding security.<br />
									  Using a case study of a medical  mannequin there was an opportunity to review, collaborate, contribute and share knowledge with pears<br />
									  on how real world  issues connected with the vulnerabilities of, and threats towards, medical implants.<br />
									  This case study was helpful in the sense that it provided an insight not only how test are been conducted but also how threats can be mitigated against.<br />
									  However, I was unable to attend the unit 2 seminar due to a clash in schedules but was able to listen to recordings which was<br />
									  instrumental in having the required insight on Threat Modeling using DREAD and STRIDE approach for analysing the security of an application
									</p>
						
									<p><h3>Unit 3</h3></p>
									<p>
									  This unit provides a brief history on the emergence of computer networking with an insight into network fundamentals,<br />
									  it’s concept, the architecture by which networking tools are designed and more importantly how to ensure security is in place for networks.<br />
									  I was able to summarise the inputs from the initial post and from other pears which emphasises the need to implement security<br />
									  at development the stage with knowledge of vulnerabilities in mind to protect medical devices. 
									</p>
									<p><h3>Unit 4</h3></p>
									<p>
									  This unit presents me with the opportunity to perform some practical activity like basic troubleshooting and investigation<br />
									  using trace route which is a command line utility that identifies the exact path a data packet takes as it travels across the internet.<br />
									  Interestingly, it was good to know how tools like WINMTR and nslookup helps with further analysis and reports generation.<br />
									  This very important when it comes to advising management, setting policies and making business decisions<br />
									  Collaboration from team was great as we are able to compare and dissect differences from our scans.
									</p>
									<p><h3>Unit 5</h3></p>
									<p>
									  This unit provides me the opportunity to explore and analyse different network tools and their security implications.<br />
									  It was paramount to have that exposure on cloud virtualisation and able to explore all the benefits it offers to business globally.<br />
									  Also, I was able to review, critically analyse and contribute to other peers scan result following  from unit from unit 4
									</p>
									<p><h3>Unit 6</h3></p>
									<p>
									  This unit exposes me to various tools that can be used for vulnerability scanning<br />
									  It was quite exciting to know quite a few numbers of tools and be able to evaluate and perform some basic assessment.<br />
									  Though there wasn’t enough time for some detailed hands-on practises however, creating time for this will provide<br />
									  provide some deep dive knowledge on which tools best suits organisation needs.<br />
									  Also, collaborated with the team in a joint review of the design document and provided some recommendation based on the Vulnerabilities identified.
									</p>
									<p><h3>Unit 7</h3></p>
									<p>
									  This unit introduced me to the concept of risk as a process of assessment and security standards as an aspect of information security management.<br />
									  I was also exposed to best practices and technologies for mitigating cyber risk.<br />
									  Getting familiarised with General Data Protections Regulation was important as this sets the standards that guarantees a consistency of<br />
									  approach and terminology hence the need to dig in on this to ensure proper implementations going forward.
									</p>
									<p><h3>Unit 8</h3></p>
									<p>
									  This unit was quite interesting as it offers the opportunity to gain in-dept understanding of various GDPR rules as it relates to the case study reviewed.<br />
									  I have a good understanding of security compliance best practices and why they are important<br />
									  thereby leaving me in a good position where I can advise an organisation on mitigation and meeting set standards<br />
									  Joining the seminar this unit was challenging as usual due to clash in schedule.<br />
									  However, it was great listening to the recordings and getting other people’s view and understanding<br />
									  of the security compliance management and it’s implementation in a world where the dynamic nature of threat and vulnerabilities remain constant.
									</p>
									<p><h3>Unit 9</h3></p>
									<p>
									  As a Quality engineer, I have some basic knowledge and exposure on logging tools but the knowledge on Forensics was entirely new and I was looking forward to it.<br />
									  I learned and familiarised with different types of logs and tools used. Also, I explored how logging is used in different incident investigation.<br />
									  Reading and learning about forensic tools and techniques was very interesting however, I must admit that at the end of this unit<br />
									  I feel there still exist a gap on the full context on how to determine the best practices around forensic in terms of techniques to use and I will work on this going forward.
									</p>
									<p><h3>Unit 10</h3></p>
									<p>
									  This unit exposes the power of check list when it comes to responding, analysing and reporting a breach which will not<br />
									  only help to keep track of progress but more importantly also helps prioritise it.<br />
									  Also, I was able to critically examine and analyse peer contribution on the security breach highlighted on<br />
									  on my initial post in week 8 and made a summary based those comments and suggestion.
									</p>
									<p><h3>Unit 11</h3></p>
									<p>
									  This unit dived more into the future of security. I learned about the emerging trend and technologies with<br />
									  respect to the awareness around the dynamic nature of threats and how to overcome this challenge.<br />
									  I also learned about all the facets of network transformation up on till network virtualisation and all the benefits associated with it.
									</p>
									</p>
									<p><h3>Unit 12</h3></p>
									<p>
									  This was very exciting unit as it caps the bits and bobs of what the entire module was involved with.<br />
									  There were learning around the internet architecture and future potentials associated with it.
									</p>
