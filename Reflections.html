									<p><h3>Unit 1</h3></p>
									<p>
									  In this unit learning was centred around a brief history of information security management and some important principle that governs the concept of information security management.<br />
									  There were discussion around cyber security roles and part ways to a fulfilling career in information security management industry though specific roles wasn’t clear at this stage,<br />
									  but the exposure on this was very helpful as it puts on the table some visibility on areas to explore when it comes to career role.<br />
									  This unit was particularly important as it forms some basics for the whole module.<br />
									  Also, there was great awareness on how the whole module was structured going forward.<br />
									  However, meeting with the group wasn’t great at this stage as we struggled with time differences across Zone.<br />
									  Overall, it was great been able to develop a contract and have our team goal mapped out irrespective of this challenge.  
									</p>
							
						
									<p><h3>Unit 2</h3></p>
									<p>
									  Following from unit 1, unit 2 offers me the opportunity to learn and explore the real challenges surrounding security.<br />
									  Using a case study of a medical  mannequin there was an opportunity to review, collaborate, contribute and share knowledge with pears<br />
									  on how real world  issues connected with the vulnerabilities of, and threats towards, medical implants.<br />
									  This case study was helpful in the sense that it provided an insight not only how test are been conducted but also how threats can be mitigated against.<br />
									  However, I was unable to attend the unit 2 seminar due to a clash in schedules but was able to listen to recordings which was<br />
									  instrumental in having the required insight on Threat Modeling using DREAD and STRIDE approach for analysing the security of an application
									</p>
						
									<p><h3>Unit 3</h3></p>
									<p>
									  This unit provides a brief history on the emergence of computer networking with an insight into network fundamentals,<br />
									  it’s concept, the architecture by which networking tools are designed and more importantly how to ensure security is in place for networks.<br />
									  I was able to summarise the inputs from the initial post and from other pears which emphasises the need to implement security<br />
									  at development the stage with knowledge of vulnerabilities in mind to protect medical devices.
