									<p><h3>Unit 1</h3></p>
									<p>
									     This unit exposed me to various definitions of risk management key concepts<br /> 
									     and principles that governs information security management and also learning and discussion<br />
									     around various standards and approach to quantify and qualify risk.<br />
									     It was particularly interesting to find out how important the type of approach adopted to measure<br />
									     and communicate security metrics to organisation. It was interesting meeting up with the group and been<br />
									     able to reach conclusion on the channels for further meetings, drawing up contracts and allocating task accordingly.<br />
									     I am particularly looking forward to this module as I haven’t done anything academically on risk before<br />
									     and transitioning through this unit gives me a very good start.  
									</p>
							
					                                <p><h3>Unit 2</h3></p>
									<p>
									    Progressing from unit1, there were further discussion around assessment approaches.<br />
									    Emphasis was laid on the differences between the approaches as well as highlighting the<br />
									    importance of and the changes brought by user participation in the process of managing risk.<br />
									    The research by Spears & Barki (2010) provided a great insight on the implementation<br />
									    of qualitative and quantitative assessment.<br />
									    However, capturing how lack of user access affects risk assessment and how and the issues<br />
									    encountered can be mitigated in 300 words as part of my assessment for a bit challenging.<br />
									    Again, meeting with group on various occasion across the unit was great as we were able to<br />
									    review and reflect on the pieces, we are working relating to status report. 
									</p>
						
									<p><h3>Unit 3</h3></p>
									<p>
									    I am very well in tuned with the process and methodologies used to implement SDLC,<br />
									    however the knowledge around how risk affects each phase of SDLC is one I was looking<br />
									    forward to adding to my toolkit hence my excitement about this unit.<br />
									    Exposure on Devops pipeline as a means of testing each release for risk and security<br />
									    issues was great as this directly applicable to my work been a quality engineer.<br />
									    There were quite challenging moment with time in this unit. The status report was due for<br />
									    submission and various meeting were held across the team to consolidate review and reflect on all the work done.<br />
									    Also find time to listen to recording of the seminar from week 2  
									</p>
									<p><h3>Unit 4</h3></p>
									<p>
									    This unit provides me with opportunity to deep dive into the discussion around common risk in<br />
									    software development life circle and the best way to mitigate them.<br />
									    One thing to hold on to going forward is that risk mitigation has the ultimate capacity<br />
									    to make or break or determine the success software development life circle.<br />
									    It was quite interesting researching and reading articles and having a discussion around<br />
									    best mitigation possible for a solution both on team and individual level.<br />
									    Justifying a chosen mitigation could be challenging as couple of articles needs to be read to surface your argument.<br />
									    Again, couldn’t  make the seminar as there are challenges around the timings.<br />
									    Various meetings was held within the group across the unit as usual and started working on the team project
									</p>
									<p><h3>Unit 5</h3></p>
									<p>
									    It was quite interesting reading around business continuity BC and having an idea<br />
									    on how to set up a plan to deal with difficulty going forward.<br />
									    It was paramount to have this disaster recovery and able to explore all the benefits it offers to business globally.<br />
									    Also, this was directly and practically applicable to the ongoing project on a group level.<br />
									    Concluding can be a bit challenging as there are different views and opinions from a different author across the globe.<br />
									    However, reviews critical analysis and collaboration with team has helped in understanding the full concept of business recovery.<br />
									    It appeared as if there were a bit of stretch in this unit  considering the dept in group work and various articles to catch up with.<br />
									    However, it was particularly interesting for me with respect to the exposure I have on business continuity.<br />
									    In between I was able to listen to the recording of the previous week seminar.
									</p>
									<p><h3>Unit 6</h3></p>
									<p>
									  This unit provides me with opportunity to explore, identify, and analyse trends that could determine the future of information risk management.
