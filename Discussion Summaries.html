									<p><h3>Unit 1</h3></p>
									<p>
									  Team meets for the first time and there was discussion around how to schedule further meetings, time availability and Task Allocation.<br />
									  We Talked about the Team contract and the approach to adopt in an attempt,  to accomplishing the task.<br />
                                                                          Team Contract Signed.
                                                                         </p> 
									 
   
									
							
						
									<p><h3>Unit 2</h3></p>
									<p>
									  Seminar 1: Stride & Dread Tools<br />
									  Austin started the first part of the project as discussed and agreed with the aim to have it done before<br />
									  the following week. Afterword’s Qasim will take over.<br />
									  Discussed the first seminar preparation assignment: Stride & Dread Tools.<br />
									  The consensus was that network security solutions are the most vulnerable of the three.<br />
									  Followed by network protocols and unsecure software.<br />
									  Another suggestion was insecure programming. We gave network security solutions a level 3-high risk and the other two-level 2-medium risk.<br />
									  We produced seven other mitigations that could be used.<br />
									  These are zero trust, IPS/IDS, packet filtering, honeypot, account lockout, cyber training, two-factor authentication.
									</p>
						
									<p><h3>Unit 3</h3></p>
									<p>
									  Reviewed Austin’s progress on the project and made changes<br />
								          Qasim will take over and write the next 200 words which is subject to review next meeting.
									  We had some Common Issues during scans like that of getting blocked on the website by its reverse proxy.<br />
									  We discovered and bypassed this using a VPN.<br />
									  Other than that, it was just basic issues associated with the commands.<br />
									  We were able to research online and watch tutorials to get a better idea about what to do.<br />
									  The results found will be valuable for the final report, and will be used as a starting point for the research.
									</p>
									<p><h3>Unit 4</h3></p>
									<p>
									  Seminar 2 Preparation: TCP/IP v ISO/OSI<br />
								          Reviewed Qasim progress on the project. Aldo will take the next 200 words.<br />
								          The consensus was split regarding whether TCP or OSI was better.<br />
									  Regardless it was unanimous that it was hard to truly envision what the modern world could’ve been like.<br />
									  For those on the OSI side, it was said to be better because of its versatility.<br />
								          On the other side TCP, was argued to be better because of its rigidity. It provides a solid framework that doesn’t necessarily change as much.<br />
									  This allows it to be better standardized. Overall, it was a very split opinion, with plenty of valid opinions. 
									</p>
									<p><h3>Unit 5</h3></p>
									<p>
									  Reviewed Aldo’s progress and made any necessary changes.<br />
									  Thomas and Kingsley will finish the paper off before the next meeting.	
									</p>
									<p><h3>Unit 6</h3></p>
									<p>
									  Seminar 3 Preparation: Evaluation Exercise.<br />
									  Final proof read of the paper as a group. We made some minor changes related to the references. Finally, we turned in the project <br />
									  We discussed the results of us going over the 8 different vulnerability tools.<br />
									  As a whole, it was agreed that it was difficult to evaluate each one given the lack of experience with them.<br />
									  As a result, the lesser-known tools like SQLMap and Jawfish were given lower scores between all of us.<br />
									  Though we were able to agree that Kali Linux is a 5/5 tool.<br />
									  It is the most versatile, free, and fairly easy to use.<br />
									  Everything else besides SQLMap and Jawfish was given a 4/5 due to their great reputations.
